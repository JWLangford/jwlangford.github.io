## About

Before diving into web development, I spent 5 years as a golf instructor, teaching across the East Coast of the US and in Beijing, China. While golf remains a beloved hobby, my passion for coding led me to pursue a career as a full-stack developer.

Now, with 8 years of experience and based in Hong Kong full-time, I continue to enjoy building impactful projects and expanding my expertise.
